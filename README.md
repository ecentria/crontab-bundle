Sequence of consumers collecting:
- Exact match will go first, if match is found collecting is finished.

## Important Notice
Ecentria Crontab Bundle schedules jobs using [Crontab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).
A best practice for two or more applications that run on the same node is to assign a different user per application.

The best practice mentioned above prevents different applications overwriting each other's configurations.
One user has only one cron table file, normally stored on /var/spool/cron/
